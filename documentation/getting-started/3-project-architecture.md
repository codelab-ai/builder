# Project Structure

[Back](../../README.md)

We follow [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) as the core principle. Many concepts are taken from the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) as well as the [Ports & Adapters or Hexagonal Architecture](https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/07/19/ports-and-adapters-architecture).

On top of that, we utilize [CQRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) & [Event Sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html)

We follow [Exception or Result](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/error-handling-exception-or-result) for validation.
