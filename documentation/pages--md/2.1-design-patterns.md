To build out our application, we use an abstract factory pattern. This has the benefit of creating inter-related products for web, native, & desktop.

The builder & strategy pattern are used within the factory. Our tree algorithm uses a Tree strategy which allows us to construct various types of trees.

The builder pattern is created to configure the order of steps for constructing our products.

The composite pattern is used for grid layouts.

Decorators can be used to add functionality to components.

Adapter pattern for integration external API's

Command pattern can be used for configuring the UI state.

This factory acts as the facade pattern, which is the the entry point for our application.
