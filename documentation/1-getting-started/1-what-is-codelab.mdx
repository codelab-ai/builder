# What is Codelab.ai

Codelab.ai is a cloud-based SaaS product designed for developers to build frontend web applications.

It's in the low-code to no-code space of software products, which is a competitive space currently. Many platforms are popping up everyday, so speed to market is very important.

## The End Product

- Users can create re-useable components, and re-use them as part of a page
- Users can configure components with props & styles
- Users can create lambda functions to bind data to components using a mapper

The end product is a highly configurable UI layer that competes with writing code.

## Architecture Concept

At it's core, Codelab is a data structure builder.

- It allows users to construct interfaces of any recursive type just as you would in Typescript.
- It allows users to construct any type of UI.

By default, a user can construct any HTML DOM tree.

For React components, the platform needs to create wrappers for UI frameworks. By default we've created a wrapper for Ant Design as a proof of concept.

We have designed a mechanism to easily add new UI into the framework for future enhancements
