# Getting Started

1. `cp .env.example .env` & get env from Slack
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn docker:up hasura`

This will call `hasura` service in `.docker/docker-compose.yaml`, which calls `postgres` as a dependency

If postgres service env vars have been modified, you'll need to delete the postgres docker volume using `docker volume ls` then `docker volume rm [volume-name]`

We have disabled Hasura console access, because migrations aren't tracked there. We want to access Hasura using a CLI command

4. `make hasura-console`

- Visit `hasura/config.yaml` & look at `endpoint` property, make sure it matches the endpoint of your hasura
