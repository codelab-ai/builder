# Getting Started

1. `cp .env.example .env` & get env from Slack
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn docker:up hasura hasura-e2e`

This will call `hasura` service in `.docker/docker-compose.yaml`, which calls `postgres` as a dependency

If postgres service env vars have been modified, you'll need to delete the postgres docker volume using `docker volume ls` then `docker volume rm [volume-name]`

We have disabled Hasura console access, because migrations aren't tracked there. We want to access Hasura using a CLI command

> The `hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.0-alpha.8.cli-migrations-v3` image doesn't work for seeding. Since order must be migration -> seeder -> metadata, we must do it manually for now.

4. `make hasura-migrations-apply`
5. `make hasura-seed-apply`
6. `make hasura-metadata-apply`

7. `make hasura-console`

<!-- - Visit `hasura/config.yaml` & look at `endpoint` property, make sure it matches the endpoint of your hasura -->
