# Prop

A `Prop` module consists of both schema and values

![Prop Module](/uploads/modules-prop.png){width=400}

## Models

### ValueType

A `ValueType` is the primitive type of our platform.

```typescript
type ValueType = 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'lambda'
```

### PropType

A `PropType` is essentially a `ValueType` with a key.

```typescript
interface PropType {
  key: string
  type: ValueType | PropTypeC
}
```

This forms a recursive relationship, where type could be of a `PropTypeC`

### PropTypeC

A `PropTypeC` is a collection of `PropType`.

```typescript
interface PropTypeC {
  propTypes: PropType[]
}
```

### PropValue

A `PropValue` is the instantiation of a `ValueType`.

```typescript
interface PropValue {
  type: ValueType
  value: any
}
```

### Prop

A `Prop` is essentially a `PropValue` with a key. The key is omitted because it can be inferred from `PropType`

```typescript
interface Prop {
  type: PropType
  values: PropValue | PropValue[]
}
```

### PropC

A `PropC` is a collection of `Prop`

`PropC` & `PropTypeC` is the public interface of the `Prop` module.

`PropC` is attached to `ComponentElement` & `PageElement`. Elements are instantiations, so it makes sense only these contain `PropC`.

`PropTypeC` is attached to `Atom` & `Component`. If a `Component` is a single `Atom`, then it's likely both `PropTypeC` are the same.

If `Component` consists of multiple `Atom`, we may want to simplify the `PropTypeC` of `Component`. Or allow additional props on `Component`, which get computed to props useable by the `Atom`.

## Prop Behavior

Since we pass props to `Component`, and not to `Atom` within the `Page`, how do props get passed to the children `Atom`?

> This still needs to be thought out more, but for now we make any props passed to `Component` accessible to all children `Atom`
