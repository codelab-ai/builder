# Component

A `Component` is a re-useable component for the UI.

> Currently we can't compose `Component` with `Component`

A `Component` is a graph, consisting of vertices of `ComponentElement` that are connected together with `Links`.

```typescript
interface Component {
  elements: ComponentElement[]
  links: Link[]
}
```

A `Link` could have different types, which will tell us what they are connecting.

> In future, we could have a `Link` that connects a `Component` with `Component`, as opposed to a `ComponentElement` with a `ComponentElement`

```typescript
type LinkType = 'Component' | 'ComponentElement'

interface Link {
  type: LinkType
  source: ComponentElement
  target: ComponentElement
  order: number
}
```

The `source` is the parent node, while the `target` the child node. If there are multiple children, we'll need an `order` field to determine the order of those children.
