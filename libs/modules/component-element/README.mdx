# ComponentElement

A `ComponentElement` gives an identity to an `Atom`.

![Component Element Module](/uploads/modules-component.png){width=400}

We wrap `Atom` with a `ComponentElement`, this means we are creating a new `Atom`, but with some preset values.

```typescript
interface ComponentElement {
  atom: Atom
}
```

We can style it differently, or configure some default behavior using props. Tags can be used to allow better search.

```typescript
interface ComponentElement {
  // atom: Atom
  styles: Style[]
  props: PropC
  tags: Tag[]
}
```

We can create variants by adding tags. A `danger` variant of a `button` would be like so.

```typescript
const componentElement = {
  type: 'AntdButton',
  props: {
    type: 'danger',
  },
  tags: ['danger'],
}
```

A `ComponentElement` is just a container to configure some variant of an atom so it can be re-used.

## What's next

But what if we want a group of `atoms` to be re-used? We can't do that with `ComponentElement` alone.

We'll need some system to construct a tree like data structure of `atoms`. This is where [Component](/modules/component/component) comes in.
